<h2>In My Dreams</h2>
  <ul>
<li> <p>By Stevie&nbsp;Smith</p>
 <hr> 
<ol>
<li><em>In my dreams I am always saying goodbye and riding away, <br>  
Whither and why I know not nor do I care.<br>
And the parting is sweet and the parting over is sweeter,<br>   
<strong>And sweetest of all is the night and the rushing air.</strong><br>
 <li>In my dreams they are always waving their hands and saying goodbye,<br>
And they give me the stirrup cup and I smile as I drink,  <br> 
I am glad the journey is set, I am glad I am going,<br>
I am glad, I am glad, that my friends don't know what I think.<br>
