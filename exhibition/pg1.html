                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>I'm a self-confessed homebody with a deep affection for Japan's vibrant anime culture. However, my lack of drawing skills posed a significant challenge in creating a personalized "waifu." Initially, my options were limited to either claiming a copyright-free image as my own or spending a significant portion of my savings on commissioning an artist. As someone who is both shy and budget-conscious, these options were far from ideal.</p>
                <p>In my quest for an alternative, I stumbled upon MakeGirlsMoe in 2017, a site developed by Yanghua Jin. Although it was an intriguing find, it didn't quite meet my expectations. My search continued until I discovered WaifuLabs by Sizigi Studios in 2019. Despite its watermark, WaifuLabs marked a considerable improvement over my initial discovery and became the source of several of my social media avatars. The only catch was the need to manually remove the watermark from each image.</p>
                <p>Fast forward to October 3, 2022, and my journey from high school to college coincided with the advent of the AI-generated art era, epitomized by the launch of NovelAI by Anlatan. This platform, especially its image generation feature, quickly gained popularity, signaling what I consider the golden age of AI artistry.</p>
                <p>The landscape of AI art took another turn when NovelAI's model was forcibly made open-source by the hacker group "4chan," making it widely accessible. Although I found NovelAI's subscription fee steep, this event led me to explore Stable Diffusion on GitHub, a preference influenced by its open-source nature over alternatives like Midjourney.</p>
                <p>The realization that tools alone weren't enough without models to drive them prompted me to delve into Hugging Face and Civitai, where I discovered the open-source model Pastel-Mix. The quality of its outputs was a revelation, pushing me to explore further. Among the models I experimented with was Cetus-Mix, which I used extensively for six months.</p>
                <p>Encouraged by these experiences, I ventured into developing large models myself. My efforts bore fruit, leading to the creation of two models I openly shared on Civitai: Wizard-Mix and FM-Mix in 2023, under my screen name Earthaoelian. These endeavors not only satisfied my creative cravings but also contributed to the broader community of AI art enthusiasts.</p>
                <p>Although there are relatively few people downloading it, I am very proud of my open source model. By the way, good luck on your AI journey my friend!</p>
