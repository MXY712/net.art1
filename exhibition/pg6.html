                <h2>Img generated by cetus-mix(2023)</h2>
                <p>cetus-mix is ​​a stylized anime mockup. cetus-mix is ​​a very good and powerful model. As a loyal user, I highly recommend it. However, it should be noted that the display page of the cetus-mix model on citizen will have some models made by users that are not suitable for work. Pictures, I recommend not opening them while working.</p>
