                <h2>Img generated by Wizard-mix(2024)</h2>
                <p>wizard-mix is ​​the work I am most proud of. I used some pictures generated by midjourney as a training set and merged them with many carefully selected pictures generated by various large models, and finally produced this model. What I'm most proud of is the color and the complexity of the image.</p>
