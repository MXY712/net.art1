                <p>The word "Waifu" comes from Japanese and is a borrowing and pronunciation adaptation of the English word "wife". In internet and anime culture, the term is used to refer to a person's extreme fondness or emotional attachment to a fictional character (usually a female character in anime, manga, or video games). This attachment can be purely based on the character's personality, appearance, or other traits. Although the original meaning referred to female characters, over time people came to use "husbando" to refer to the same affection for male characters as well, although the term is used relatively rarely. Simply put, "waifu" is a term used in the anime and game fan communities to express deep feelings for virtual female characters.</p>
